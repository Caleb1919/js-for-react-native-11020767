Task 1: Processing the Numbers Array
The first task involves transforming each number in an array based on its parity (even or odd). This transformation prepares numerical data for subsequent processing or analysis by applying specific rules to each element of the array.The function ensures each number in the array is transformed based on a consistent rule, producing a new array where each element reflects the applied mathematical operation (squaring for even numbers, multiplication by three for odd numbers).

Task 2: Formatting the Strings Array
The second task focuses on formatting an array of strings based on corresponding processed numbers. This ensures that textual data aligns with the transformed numerical data, facilitating cohesive data presentation and analysis.The function ensures consistency between numerical transformations and textual representation by formatting each string according to the parity of its corresponding number. This linkage maintains clarity and coherence in data visualization and interpretation.

Task 3: Creating User Profiles
Purpose:
The final task involves creating structured user profiles using original and modified strings. Each profile includes an identifier (id), the original string (originalName), and its formatted counterpart (modifiedName), facilitating organized data management and retrieval.This
ensures that the transformation from original to modified data is captured and structured efficiently, supporting various data-driven processes and applications effectively.
